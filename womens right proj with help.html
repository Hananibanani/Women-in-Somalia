      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Women everywhere are sadly targets of all types of violence, but in Somalia it has become treated as daily life — just another case, instead of something that should outrage us.
We are taught to be patient, to be careful, and to not speak about the things happening.
“What can we do about it?” they ask, while pushing the same ideas that created this reality in the first place. <br>
Today, we will try to understand the problem. <br>
Why are we the way we are? <br>
Why does change seem impossible? <br>
Why is progress seen as the enemy?</p>
    </section>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p> When the public is outraged, change can happen — but outrage in Somalia is selective. <br>
Many victims never receive justice, especially when cultural or clan loyalties protect the perpetrators. <br>
<br>
A man burns his wife and children, and walks free because of clan support. <br>
Another assaults an infant with his peers, then murders her. <br>
Another thirty decide to destroy the lives of two schoolgirls who were preparing for their final exams. <br>
<br>
Despite the anger, the tension, and the endless tears — have we seen justice? <br>
No. We simply have not. <br>
<br>
Women continue to live like prey. 
Children continue to be used and abused. <br>
The powerless continue to be betrayed by the same people who swore they would protect them. <br>
<br>
It is a sad and dark reality, yet our elders tell us to turn a blind eye because “thinking too much” about these issues has a negative impact on our minds.
I know they mean well — this is how they survived.
But our minds have already been affected.
They have already been permanently stained with the memories of the pictures and videos of Saabriin and all the other children who have been beaten, harmed, and killed. <br>
<br>
It is truly heartbreaking that our elders take pride in clan identity and where they come from, while all we see is a home filled with violence, oppression, and injustice. <br>
<br>
A home decorated in the blood of the innocent.</p>

      <h2>Our Objective</h2>
      <p>This website — and the resources available here — exist to bring comfort, to inform, and to be a safe space for women everywhere. It also serves as a tool to raise awareness of what is happening in the land we call home. <br>
<br>
Thanks to social media, many injustices and forms of corruption that were once hidden are now being exposed. <br>
Teachers and uncles who were trusted with the wellbeing of our children have shown their true faces. <br>
Institutions whose entire existence relied on the abuse of women and children have finally been seen for what they really are. <br>
<br>
A few of my favourite influencers and speakers on these topics are:</p>

  <h2>Why I Made This</h2>
  <p>I’m not doing this as a professional. <br>
I’m doing this as a Somali girl who is tired of watching other women suffer in silence. <br>
I don’t have all the answers, and I’m still learning, but I believe that talking about these issues matters. <br>
If this space brings comfort, information, or hope to even one woman, then this entire effort has meaning.

    Thank you for taking the time to read and reflect.
